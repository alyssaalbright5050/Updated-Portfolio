# Updated-Portfolio

This is my Portfolio.  I have improved the look of the Portfolio page by adding BootStrap with a carousel element to display my GitHub repos. Click on any picture in the Portfolio tab to go directly to the repo.  Recently added my Project-2 assignment from BootCamp, entitled "What's Your Flavor?"  It was a collaboration project between myself and two other BootCamp students.
